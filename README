banshee2amarok - Convert banshee track play counts and ratings to amarok.

Copyright 2011 Philipp Ittershagen <p.ittershagen@googlemail.com>

This script converts the banshee music play counts and song ratings to the
amarok database. It searches for tracks which where played or rated in the
banshee database and then tries to find the track entry in the amarok
database. If the track was found,, the play count and the rating will be
written to the amarok database.

Inspired by https://github.com/saschpe/amarok2clementine.

Tested with Amarok 2.4 and Banshee 2.2.
