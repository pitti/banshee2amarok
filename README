This script converts the banshee music play counts and song ratings to the
amarok database. It searches for played or rated tracks in the banshee
database and then tries to find the track entry in the amarok database.
If the track was found, the play count and the rating is written to the
amarok database.

Inspired by https://github.com/saschpe/amarok2clementine.

Tested with Amarok 2.4 and Banshee 2.2.
